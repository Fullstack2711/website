Neon's Enterprise plan is designed for teams that need scale, performance, and hands-on support. It includes access to all Neon features, priority support, and a dedicated Slack channel with our team. We’ll work with you to shape a plan that fits your workload and operational goals.

## Why Neon for Enterprise

Neon combines the power of Postgres with a modern serverless architecture to help you scale fast and ship confidently.

- **Serverless Postgres** – Instant autoscaling of CPU, memory, and connections
- **10,000+ connections** – Built-in pooling with no timeouts
- **Database branching** – Create production-grade environments on the fly
- **Multi-tenancy** – Project-level isolation for tenant data and resources
- **High availability and disaster recovery** – PITR, branching, and multi-AZ durability
- **Security and compliance** – HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA
- **Expert support** – Priority support and direct access to our team of Postgres engineers

## Who is the Enterprise plan for?

### SaaS platforms embedding Postgres
Offer Postgres to your users with built-in scalability, fast provisioning, and API-level control. [Learn how Retool manages 300K+ databases](https://neon.tech/blog/how-retool-uses-retool-and-the-neon-api-to-manage-300k-postgres-databases).

### Teams managing database fleets
Provision and manage thousands of databases with API-driven workflows. Use branching and autoscaling to reduce operational overhead and control costs.

### AI platforms and agentic apps
Spin up Postgres instances instantly for agent workloads, data processing, or long-lived sessions. Ideal for real-time inference and rapid prototyping.

### Multi-tenant applications
Isolate customer data into separate Neon projects to meet compliance requirements and avoid noisy neighbors. Built-in autoscaling and usage tracking help you stay efficient.

### Engineering teams at scale
Accelerate development workflows with branching, preview environments, and database automation. Move faster without managing Postgres infrastructure.
