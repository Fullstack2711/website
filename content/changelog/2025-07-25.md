- **Datadog and OpenTelemetry integrations**

  We enhanced the integration cards (accessible from your project's **Integrations** page in the Neon Console) for [Datadog](/docs/guides/datadog) and [OpenTelemetry](/docs/guides/opentelemetry) to give you better visibility into your export activity:
  - **Export statistics**: Now show how many metrics and logs were exported in the last 5 minutes, using easy-to-read K/M formatting.
  - **Failure alerts**: Warn you of recent export issues with clear error and warning messages.

  These updates make it easier to monitor your integrations at a glance.

- **Neon Console**

- **Drizzle Studio update**
  - Drizzle Studio, which powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console, has been updated to version [version]. For details about the latest updates, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
