## OpenTelemetry integration

Neon now supports OpenTelemetry! You can send metrics and events from Neon to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. You can enable the integration from the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console. For setup instructions, refer to our [OpenTelemetry docs](tbd).

## Data API now open to all Neon users

We're excited to announce the **Neon Data API** is now open to all users. Instantly turn your Neon Postgres database into a REST API. No backend required. Query tables, views, and functions right from your client app using standard HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`), powered by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org).

**What can you do with the Neon Data API?**

- Query your database from any client using HTTP or PostgREST-compatible SDKs (`postgrest-js`, `postgrest-py`, `postgrest-go`)
- Secure your API with Neon Auth or your own JWKS

Once enabled, you'll get a unique API endpoint for your project. Here's how you might query your data from `postgrest-js`:

```javascript shouldWrap
const { data, error } = await postgrest
  .from('notes')
  .select('id, title, created_at, owner_id, shared')
  .eq('owner_id', user.id)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

[Learn more in our getting started guide](/docs/data-api/get-started).

- **API key-based authentication for the Neon MCP Server**

  The Neon MCP Sever now supports API key-based authentication for remote access, in addition to OAuth. This allows for simpler authentication using your [Neon API key (personal or organization)](/docs/manage/api-keys) for programmatic access.

  ```bash
  {
  "mcpServers": {
    "Neon": {
      "url": "https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <$NEON_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
