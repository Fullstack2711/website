## OpenTelemetry integration

Neon now supports OpenTelemetry! You can send metrics and events from Neon to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. Enable the integration from the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console.

## Data API now open to all Neon users

We're excited to announce the **Neon Data API** is now open to all users. Instantly turn your Neon Postgres database into a REST API. No backend required. Query tables, views, and functions right from your client app using standard HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`), powered by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org).

**What can you do with the Neon Data API?**

- Query your database from any client using HTTP or PostgREST-compatible SDKs (`postgrest-js`, `postgrest-py`, `postgrest-go`)
- Secure your API with Neon Auth or your own JWKS

Once enabled, you'll get a unique API endpoint for your project. Here's how you might query your data from `postgrest-js`:

```javascript shouldWrap
const { data, error } = await postgrest
  .from('notes')
  .select('id, title, created_at, owner_id, shared')
  .eq('owner_id', user.id)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

- **API key-based authentication for the Neon MCP Server**

  The Neon MCP Sever now supports API key-based authentication for remote access, in addition to OAuth. This allows for simpler authentication using your Neon API key (personal or organization) for programmatic access.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  - To make time selection easier, we've added a time selection option to date and time selectors in the Neon Console.

- **Neon CLI**

  - The `neon projects create` and `neon projects update` commands now support a `--hipaa` option for enabling HIPAA for Neon projects. Neon offers HIPAA compliance as part of our Business and Enterprise plans.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  - Drizzle Studio, which powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console, has been updated to version 1.0.22. For details about the latest updates, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Neon Datadog integration**

  - The sample dashboard provided for the [Neon Datadog integration](/docs/guides/datadog) now includes a panel that displays Postgres logs. For dashboard setup instructions, see [Import the Neon dashboard](/docs/guides/datadog#import-the-neon-dashboard).

- **Postgres settings**

  - We've enabled `enable_hashjoin`, which allows the Postgres query planner to use hash join strategies for improved performance on large or unsorted datasets.
  - We've set `log_min_duration_statement` to `1000`, which means that queries taking longer than 1 second are now logged to help identify and troubleshoot slow-performing SQL statements.
