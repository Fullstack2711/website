- **Neon CLI**

  - The Neon CLI now supports a `--name` option that you can use to name a compute when adidng a compute to a Neon branch. This option is helpful when a branch has multiple computes. A Neon branch can have a single read-write compute and multiple read-only computes, serving as [read replicas](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

    ```bash
    neon branches add-compute mybranch --name myreplica --type read_only
    ``` 

  - The CLI now automatically detects invalid credentials (401 responses), deletes them, and prompts for re-authentication instead of failing immediately

  ðŸš€ If you're not using the Neon CLI yet, get set up in just a few steps with the [Neon CLI Quickstart](/docs/reference/cli-quickstart).
