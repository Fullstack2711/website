title: Name your computes, OAuth provider management in Neon Auth, and more
---

## Give your computes a custom name

You can now assign custom names to your branchâ€™s computes. In the Neon Console, go to the **Branches** page, select a branch, and open the **Compute** tab. Click the edit icon next to a compute to rename it.

![Naming computes](/docs/relnotes/name_computes.png)

You can also set a name when _adding_ a new compute.

This enhancement is supported for both primary (read-write) and [read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) computes.

## OAuth provider management for Neon Auth

You can now manage your project's OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft) directly in the **Neon Auth** config tabâ€”enable or disable providers, and choose between using shared Stack Auth credentials or setting up your own custom client credentials.

New API endpoints also let you manage providers programmatically:

- [Add an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/addneonauthoauthprovider)
- [List OAuth providers](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listneonauthoauthproviders)
- [Update an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateneonauthoauthprovider)
- [Delete an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteneonauthoauthprovider)

To learn more, see the [Neon Auth](/docs/neon-auth/overview) documentation.

## OpenTelemetry integration enhancement

We recently introduced support for **OpenTelemetry**, allowing to send metrics and Postgres logs from Neon to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. This week, we improved on the integration with non-blocking validation. When setting up an integration, we now check connectivity to the specified collector endpoint and provide immediate feedback. If validation fails, you can choose to **Continue anyway**, giving you the flexibility to proceed without a successful check.

This change helps surface misconfigurations early while preserving control for advanced use cases.

To learn more about the OpenTelemetry integration, refer to our [OpenTelemetry docs](/docs/guides/opentelemetry).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon CLI**

  - The Neon CLI now supports a `--name` option that you can use when adding a compute or a read replica to a Neon branch.

    ```bash
    neon branches add-compute mybranch --name myreplica --type read_only
    ```

  - The CLI now automatically detects invalid credentials (401 responses), deletes them, and prompts for re-authentication instead of failing immediately

    > ðŸš€ If you're not using the Neon CLI yet, get set up in just a few steps with the [Neon CLI Quickstart](/docs/reference/cli-quickstart).

- **Fixes**

  - Addressed an issue where projects created via Netlify and claimed into Vercel-managed or accounts could lose certain project configuration settings. To avoid this issue, transfers of projects created via Netlify to Vercel-managed org accounts are currently not supported.
