## Name your computes

You can now assign custom names to your branchâ€™s computes. In the Neon Console, go to the **Branches** page, select a branch, and open the **Compute** tab. Click the edit icon next to a compute to rename it.

This update applies to both primary (read-write) and [read replica](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/read-replicas) computes. You can also set a name when _adding_ a new compute.

## OAuth provider management for Neon Auth

You can now manage your project's OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft) directly in the **Neon Auth** config tabâ€”enable or disable providers, and choose between using shared Stack Auth credentials or setting up your own custom client credentials.

New API endpoints also let you manage providers programmatically:

- [Add an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/addneonauthoauthprovider)
- [List OAuth providers](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listneonauthoauthproviders)
- [Update an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateneonauthoauthprovider)
- [Delete an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteneonauthoauthprovider)

To learn more, see the [Neon Auth](/docs/neon-auth/overview) documentation.

## OpenTelemetry integration enhancements

We recently introduced supports OpenTelemetry, allowing to send metrics and Postgres logs from Neon to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. This week, we introduced some enhancements:

- **Non-blocking validation for OpenTelemetry integrations**: When setting up an integration, we now check connectivity to the specified collector endpoint and provide immediate feedback. If validation fails, you can choose to **Continue anyway**, giving you the flexibility to proceed without a successful check.
- **Enhanced telemetry monitoring**: We'll now show warnings in the UI when no exported telemetry counts are found for a project, including the project ID for improved debugging and monitoring visibility.

For more about our OpenTelemetry, refer to our [OpenTelemetry docs](/docs/guides/opentelemetry).

**API update:** The `OpentelemetryIntegrationCreateRequest` and `OpentelemetryIntegrationUpdateRequest` objects now include an optional `skip_validation` field to bypass endpoint checks programmatically.

This change helps surface misconfigurations early while preserving control for advanced use cases.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon CLI**
  - The Neon CLI now supports a `--name` option that you can use to name a compute when adding a compute to a Neon branch. This option is helpful when a branch has multiple computes. A Neon branch can have a single read-write compute and multiple read-only computes, serving as [read replicas](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

    ```bash
    neon branches add-compute mybranch --name myreplica --type read_only
    ```

  - The CLI now automatically detects invalid credentials (401 responses), deletes them, and prompts for re-authentication instead of failing immediately

  ðŸš€ If you're not using the Neon CLI yet, get set up in just a few steps with the [Neon CLI Quickstart](/docs/reference/cli-quickstart).
