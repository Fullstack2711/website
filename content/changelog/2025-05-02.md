title: Neon Local for Docker, Console improvements, and more

## Introducing Neon Local to simplify Postgres in your Docker development environment

Neon Local lets you spin up and tear down isolated, production-like Postgres branches right from your local machine or CI, using Docker.

- Automatically creates a new branch when your container starts and cleans it up when you're done
- Works with any Postgres client, including the Neon serverless driver
- Handles routing and authentication to your cloud database without manual configuration

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  - Fixed an issue where the connection string for a read replica could sometimes display the main (read-write) replica's connection string in the Connect modal. The correct connection string is now always shown.
  - Fixed an issue where the Console could display a read replica as the primary compute (or vice versa) in the Computes list on the Branch details page. This made it unclear which instance you were managing or observing. The correct compute is now always shown under the correct label.
  - Moved the branch selector to the sidebar for easier access. This and other recent changes are part of laying the groundwork for a more streamlined Console navigation experience coming soon â€“ stay tuned!

   _P.S. Notice the branch named `production_from_snapshot_...` in the screenshot? That's a branch restored from a snapshot, an Early Access feature announced last week. Join our [Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try out snapshots._
