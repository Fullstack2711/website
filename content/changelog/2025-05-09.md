## Neon on Azure is now generally available

We're excited to announce that Neon on Azure is now generally available! After a successful beta period, Neon is now fully supported as an Azure Native ISV Service, allowing you to deploy and manage Neon Postgres databases directly from the Azure portal.

The GA release includes several new features and enhancements:

- **Support for additional Azure regions** including Azure Germany West Central (Frankfurt) and Azure West US 3 (Arizona)
- **Azure Service Connector integration** for simplified connectivity between Azure services (like App Service or Azure Functions) and your Neon Postgres database
- **Create and manage branches directly in the Azure portal** for streamlined development workflows
- **Retrieve connection strings from the Azure interface** for easier application setup
- **Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) eligibility** - Neon Postgres purchases made through the Azure Marketplace count toward your committed Azure spend
