## Neon on Azure is now generally available

We're excited to announce that Neon on Azure is now generally available! After a successful beta period, Neon is now fully supported as an Azure Native ISV Service, allowing you to deploy and manage Neon Postgres databases directly from the Azure portal.

The GA release includes several new features and enhancements:

- **Support for additional Azure regions** including Azure Germany West Central (Frankfurt) and Azure West US 3 (Arizona)
- **Azure Service Connector integration** for simplified connectivity between Azure services (like App Service or Azure Functions) and your Neon Postgres database
- **Create and manage branches directly in the Azure portal** for streamlined development workflows
- **Retrieve connection strings from the Azure interface** for easier application setup
- **Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) eligibility** - Neon Postgres purchases made through the Azure Marketplace count toward your committed Azure spend

## ðŸ“º In case you missed it: 20 Years of Hacking Postgres with Heikki Linnakangas

Neon co-founder and Postgres core contributor Heikki Linnakangas joins Aaron Francis for a wide-ranging conversation on two decades of Postgres development. Heikki shares stories from the early days, the origin of Neon, and what's next for Postgres and serverless databases.

## Support for PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension (experimental)

Neon now supports the [PostgreSQL Anonymizer (anon)](/docs/extensions/postgresql-anonymizer) extension, enabling you to mask sensitive data in development and testing environments. **This extension is currently experimental in Neon** and must be explicitly enabled.

The initial support includes **static masking**, which permanently replaces personal data with anonymized values. You can also automate anonymization using Neon branches and GitHub Actions. Learn more in our guide on [automating data anonymization with GitHub Actions](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization).

## âœ¨ New AI-friendly options in Docs

To support workflows that use AI tools, Neon Docs now includes two new options on every page:

- **Copy page as markdown** â€“ copy the full content in markdown format.
- **Open in ChatGPT** â€“ open the page in ChatGPT with a prefilled `READ <url>` instruction.

These options make it easier to bring Neon documentation into your AI-assisted workflows.

We also provide an LLM-friendly version of our documentation at [https://neon.tech/llms.txt](https://neon.tech/llms.txt).
