<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  - tbd

- **Neon MCP Server**

  - The `list_projects` and `create_project` MCP tools now return Neon organization details.

- **Fixes**

  - Fixed an issue issue with a [pgrag](/docs/extensions/pgrag) extension function. A query using the `rag_bge_small_en_v15.embedding_for_passage` function failed to complete.
  - Fixed an issue where reaching the `max_client_conn` limit in PgBouncer could cause the connection info cache to be invalidated. This led to repeated attempts to wake the compute. The system now correctly identifies this condition as non-retriable and avoids unnecessary retries.
