- **Neon MCP Server**

  The Neon MCP Server previously defaulted to the `neondb_owner` role when no Postgres role is provided, resulting in database access failures. It now uses the owner of the selected database instead. If a non-existent role is specified, the tool fails as expected.

  If no database is provided, the server first looks for one named `neondb`; if not found, it falls back to the first available database. 

- **Neon API**

- **Neon CLI**

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.20. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
