## New default project setup with production and development branches

New Neon projects now start with a better out-of-the-box setup to support your dev workflow.

Instead of a single `main` branch, you'll now get:

- A `production` branch (the default), designed for your production workload. It’s configured with a larger compute size (1–4 CU).

- A `development` branch, created as a child of production, intended for local development. It uses a smaller compute size (0.25–1 CU).

This setup helps you separate dev and prod from day one, making it easier to start building with Neon.

## Neon MCP Server on Zed

You can now try the Neon MCP Server on [Zed](https://zed.dev/), a next-generation AI-powered code editor. For setup instructions, see [Get started with Zed and Neon Postgres MCP Server](https://neon.tech/guides/zed-mcp-neon).

MCP support in Zed is currently in **preview**. Ensure you're using the Preview version of Zed to add MCP servers. You can download the **Preview** version from [zed.dev/releases/preview](https://zed.dev/releases/preview).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon MCP Server**

  The Neon MCP Server previously defaulted to the `neondb_owner` role when no Postgres role is provided, resulting in database access failures. It now uses the owner of the selected database instead. If a non-existent role is specified, the tool fails as expected.

  If no database is provided, the server first looks for one named `neondb`; if not found, it falls back to the first available database. 

- **Neon API**

- **Neon CLI**

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.20. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
