## Introducing the Neon Data API (Early Access)

We're excited to introduce the **Neon Data API**, now available in Early Access. This feature provides a RESTful API on top of your Neon Postgres database, powered by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org). It enables direct access to tables, views, and functions using standard HTTP verbs—ideal for client-side applications and rapid prototyping.

With the Neon Data API, you can:

- Query tables with HTTP requests
- Use PostgREST-compatible SDKs like `postgrest-js`
- Scale the API alongside your Neon database
- Secure access with Neon Auth or bring your own JWKS (e.g., Auth0, Clerk)

**Enabling the Data API**  
You can enable the API from the Neon Console or programmatically via our new `POST /data-api` endpoint. Each branch can have its own API instance.

Example request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches/<branch_id>/data-api'
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
  --data '{ "database_name": "mydb" }'
```

**Authentication**  
By default, Neon Auth is provisioned with your API. You can also configure your own `jwks_url` for third-party auth providers:

```bash
curl --location 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches/<branch_id>/data-api'
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
  --data '{ "jwks_url": "https://your-auth.com/.well-known/jwks.json" }'
```

**Getting started**  
Once enabled, your REST endpoint is ready in about 15 seconds. Here's a sample request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://<your-api-url>/playing_with_neon'
     --header 'Accept: application/json'
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>'
```

**Example with postgrest-js**

```javascript
import { PostgrestClient } from '@supabase/postgrest-js'

const client = new PostgrestClient('https://<your-api-url>', {
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer <jwt>' }
})

const { data } = await client
  .from('playing_with_neon')
  .select('*')
  .gte('value', 0.5')

console.table(data)
```

Learn more in our [Data API documentation](/docs/guides/data-api).

## New credit system

We’ve launched a new credit system in the Neon Console that we plan to use for future promotions, referrals, and goodwill credits. To kick things off, we're offering a $20.00 credit when you upgrade to a paid Neon plan.

[Claim your $20 credit](https://t.co/RryvWZIxWX)

The credit will appear at the top of the Neon console and will be automatically applied to your account when you upgrade.

## TBD: Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.18](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.19/), [15.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.13/), [16.9](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.9/), and [17.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.5/), respectively.

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts (for any reason). For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon MCP Server**

  - We added a new MCP client authentication request dialog to the remote Neon MCP Server that displays the MCP client's name, website, and redirect URIs before authentication begins. The approvals are saved to a signed cookie for subsequent authentication requests.

- **Private Networking**

  - Fixed an issue that prevented some Private Networking users from using Private DNS.

- **Neon Console**

  - Various UI improvements and bug fixes

- **Neon API**

  - Performance optimizations for API endpoints

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.0.21. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
