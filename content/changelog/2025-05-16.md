## Introducing the Neon Data API (Early Access)

We're excited to introduce the **Neon Data API**, now available in Early Access. This feature provides a RESTful API on top of your Neon Postgres database, powered by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org). It enables direct access to tables, views, and functions using standard HTTP verbsâ€”ideal for client-side applications and rapid prototyping.

With the Neon Data API, you can:

- Query tables with HTTP requests
- Use PostgREST-compatible SDKs like `postgrest-js`
- Scale the API alongside your Neon database
- Secure access with Neon Auth or bring your own JWKS (e.g., Auth0, Clerk)

**Enabling the Data API**  
You can enable the API from the Neon Console or programmatically via our new `POST /data-api` endpoint. Each branch can have its own API instance.

Example request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches/<branch_id>/data-api'
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
  --data '{ "database_name": "mydb" }'
```

**Authentication**  
By default, Neon Auth is provisioned with your API. You can also configure your own `jwks_url` for third-party auth providers:

```bash
curl --location 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches/<branch_id>/data-api'
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
  --data '{ "jwks_url": "https://your-auth.com/.well-known/jwks.json" }'
```

**Getting started**  
Once enabled, your REST endpoint is ready in about 15 seconds. Here's a sample request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://<your-api-url>/playing_with_neon'
     --header 'Accept: application/json'
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>'
```

**Example with postgrest-js**

```javascript
import { PostgrestClient } from '@supabase/postgrest-js'

const client = new PostgrestClient('https://<your-api-url>', {
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer <jwt>' }
})

const { data } = await client
  .from('playing_with_neon')
  .select('*')
  .gte('value', 0.5')

console.table(data)
```
