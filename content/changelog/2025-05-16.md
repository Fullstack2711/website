## Introducing the Neon Data API (Private Preview)

We're excited to introduce the **Neon Data API**, now available in **Private Preview**.

<Admonition type="comingSoon" title="Request Access">
Want to try it out? Message us from the [Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) or on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) and we'll send you an invite.
</Admonition>

This feature provides a RESTful API on top of your Neon Postgres database, powered by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org). It enables direct access to tables, views, and functions using standard HTTP verbs—ideal for client-side applications and rapid prototyping.

With the Neon Data API, you can:

- Query tables with HTTP requests
- Use PostgREST-compatible SDKs like `postgrest-js`
- Scale the API alongside your Neon database
- Secure access with Neon Auth or bring your own JWKS (e.g., Auth0, Clerk)

**Enabling the Data API**

You can enable the API from the Neon Console or programmatically via our new `POST /data-api` endpoint. Each branch can have its own API instance.

Example request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches/<branch_id>/data-api'
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
  --data '{ "database_name": "mydb" }'
```

**Authentication**

By default, Neon Auth is provisioned with your API. You can also configure your own `jwks_url` for third-party auth providers:

```bash
curl --location 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches/<branch_id>/data-api'
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
  --data '{ "jwks_url": "https://your-auth.com/.well-known/jwks.json" }'
```

**Getting started**

Once enabled, your REST endpoint is ready in about 15 seconds. Here's a sample request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://<your-api-url>/playing_with_neon'
     --header 'Accept: application/json'
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>'
```

**Example with postgrest-js**

```javascript
import { PostgrestClient } from '@supabase/postgrest-js';

const client = new PostgrestClient('https://<your-api-url>', {
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer <jwt>' },
});

const { data } = await client.from('playing_with_neon').select('*').gte('value', 0.5);

console.table(data);
```

## Neon credits

We’ve launched a new Neon credit system in the console that we'll use for promotions, referrals, and goodwill. To test the new system, we're offering a $20.00 credit to Free plan users who upgrade to a paid Neon plan.

[Claim your $20 credit](https://t.co/RryvWZIxWX)

The credit will appear at the top of the Neon console and is automatically applied to your account when you upgrade.

## Collapsible console sidebar

You asked, we delivered. The Neon Console sidebar is now collapsible, giving you more space to focus on your work. Perfect for smaller screens or when you just need a little extra room.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon MCP Server**

  - We added a new MCP client authentication request dialog to the remote Neon MCP Server that displays the MCP client's name, website, and redirect URIs before authentication begins. The approvals are saved for subsequent authentication requests.

- **Private Networking**

  - We fixed an issue that prevented some Private Networking users from using Private DNS.

- **Neon Console**

  - We updated the **Create project** modal launched from the **New Project** button on the Projects page to use the same newer modal used elsewhere in the console.
  - The new **Backup & Restore** page (available to [Early Access](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/roadmap#join-the-neon-early-access-program) users) which supports snapshots can now be enabled via a toggle on the Restore page in the Neon console. The toggle lets you switch back and forth between the new Backup & Restore page and the current restore page. To learn more, see [Backup & Restore](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/backup-restore).

    ![backup & restore toggle](/docs/relnotes/backup_restore_toggle.png)

  - We added support for transferring multiple projects from one organization to another.

    ![multiple project transfer](/docs/relnotes/multiple_project_transfer.png)

- **Neon API**

  - The [Retrieve project consumption metrics](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconsumptionhistoryperproject) API now returns a `logical_size_bytes_hour` value, which is the logical data size consumed on an hourly basis.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  - The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.0.21. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Fixes**

  - Fixed an issue that caused an `Org not found` error to be displayed in the Neon Console immediately after creating a new org.
