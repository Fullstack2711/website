## Delete Neon Auth users from the UI

You can now delete Neon Auth users directly from the Auth UI.

![Delete Neon Auth user from UI](/docs/relnotes/delete_user.png)

Previously, deleting a user required running a SQL statement against the `neon_auth.users_sync` table. Now, you can manage users more easily from the Console, or programmatically using the [Delete Auth User API endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteneonauthuser).

## Improved branch creation UI

We’ve added some polish to our branch creation page to make it easier to understand your options:

- The UI now displays the **size limit** for schema-only branches based on your plan, so you’ll know up front how much data you can seed or add.
- There’s now a direct link to our anonymization [docs](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization) in the **Anonymized data** option, a reminder that you can anonymize data manually while we work on full in-app support.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
  - When adding an OpenTelemetry (OTel) integration, credential validation is now non-blocking. If we detect an issue, you’ll see a warning, but you can still continue if you choose to. Useful for connecting to a provider we can't fully validate yet.

- **Drizzle Studio update**
  - Drizzle Studio, which powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console, has been updated to version [VERSION]. For details about the latest updates, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
