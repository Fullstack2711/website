## [Feature A title]

[Description of Feature A]

## Support for Postgres Event Triggers

The `neon_superuser` role now supports Postgres [Event Triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-triggers.html). Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events.

Event trigger support enables various tools and platforms that utilize this functionality, including [pgroll](https://pgroll.com/), [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/), and [Readyset](https://readyset.io/), among others.

For more about event triggers, see [PostgreSQL Event Trigger](/postgresql/postgresql-triggers/postgresql-event-trigger).

## Neon Launchpad now supports database seeding

  > Neon Launchpad enables instant provisioning of a Postgres database without configuration or account creation. If you're not familiar, you can learn more here: [Neon Launchpad: A Tool For Instant Postgres, No Login Needed](https://neon.com/blog/neon-launchpad)

  [Neon Launchpad](/docs/reference/neon-launchpad) now supports database seeding, allowing developers to automatically populate databases with SQL scripts during database initialization. This feature streamlines the development workflow by enabling instant database setup with sample data. The seeding capability is also available through the Vite plugin integration, making it accessible in Vite-based projects.

  To try it from your terminal:

  ```bash
  npx neondb --seed /path/to/file.sql
  ```
