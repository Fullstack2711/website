[Description of Feature A]

## Support for Postgres Event Triggers

The `neon_superuser` role now supports Postgres [Event Triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-triggers.html). Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events.

Event trigger support enables various tools and platforms that utilize this functionality, including [pgroll](https://pgroll.com/), [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/), and [Readyset](https://readyset.io/), among others.

For more about event triggers, see [PostgreSQL Event Trigger](/postgresql/postgresql-triggers/postgresql-event-trigger).
