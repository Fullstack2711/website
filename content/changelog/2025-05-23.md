## Feature improvements

Description of feature improvements for this week.

## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.18](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.18/), [15.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.13/), [16.9](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.9/), and [17.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.5/), respectively.

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts (for any reason). For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

## Import Data Assistant enhancements

The [Import Data Assistant](/docs/import/import-data-assistant), primarily intended for importing from other Postgres platforms, can now also be used for Postgres version and region updates, making it easier to migrate your data while changing these settings.
