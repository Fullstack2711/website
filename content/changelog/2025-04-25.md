## Postgres logs support for Datadog

Neon now supports export of Postgres logs to Datadog. This feature allows you to monitor and analyze your Postgres logs directly in your Datadog dashboard, providing enhanced observability for your database operations. The Neon Datadog integration is supported on the Neon Scale and Business plans.

## pg_search extension now available on Postgres 14, 15, and 16

The pg_search extension is now available on Neon projects using Postgres versions 14, 15, and 16. This powerful full-text search extension enables you to implement advanced search capabilities in your applications with minimal configuration.

To use pg_search, you'll need to load the required libraries with a simple Update project API call before installing the extension. Detailed instructions are available in our documentation: [Enable the pg_search extension](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg_search#enable-the-pgsearch-extension).
