## Neon VS Code Extension now available

We now have a Neon VS Code Extension in the VS Code Marketplace and OpenVSX Marketplace (for Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code forks)! ðŸŽ‰

The extension provides seamless integration with Neon databases directly from your IDE, making it easier to manage your database connections and workflows without leaving your development environment.
