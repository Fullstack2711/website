## Neon Local Connect for VS Code

The [Neon Local Connect VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=databricks.neon-local-connect) lets you develop with Neon using a familiar localhost connection string. Your app connects to `localhost:5432` like a local Postgres instance, but Neon Local routes traffic to your actual Neon branch in the cloud.

**Key features:**

- **Static connection string**: Use `postgres://neon:npg@localhost:5432/neondb` for all branches â€” no need to update your app config when switching branches
- **Branch management**: Create, switch, or reset branches directly from the VS Code panel
- **Ephemeral branches**: Automatically create and cleanup temporary branches for testing and experiments
- **Integrated tools**: Launch psql shell, SQL Editor, or Table View without leaving your IDE

The extension is available on both the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=databricks.neon-local-connect) and [OpenVSX Marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/databricks/neon-local-connect) (for Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code forks).

**Requirements**: Docker Desktop and VS Code 1.85.0+
