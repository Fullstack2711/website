## app.build adds web UI and Laravel support

[app.build](https://app.build), Neon's open-source reference architecture for agentic codegen, now has a web-based interface in addition to the terminal CLI‚Äîmaking it easier to create full-stack apps directly from your browser. Learn more in the blog post: [Launching a Web UI for app.build](https://neon.com/blog/launching-a-web-ui-for-app-build)

**app.build** also now supports building and deploying **Laravel apps**. Check out the blog post: [Generate Laravel Apps from a Prompt](https://neon.com/blog/generate-laravel-apps-from-a-prompt) 

Thanks to the the [@laravelphp](https://x.com/laravelphp) team for helping us build the template ü§ù

## Create roles, add privileges, define RLS policies, and manage your database schema in the Neon Console

Drizzle Studio, which powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console, has been updated to a new version, which introduces several new features.

### Create Postgres roles

You can now create Postgres roles from the **Tables** page. Define a role name, select from commonly granted privileges, set a password, and click **Review and Create**.

### Add privileges

For more advanced privilege assignments, click the **Add privilge** link when creating a role to build your `GRANT` statements.

### Define RLS policies

Define your own Postgres RLS policies or use a predefined RLS policy template. The "based on `user_id`" templates are for use with our [Neon RLS](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-rls) feature, which integrates  third-party JWT-based authentication providers like Auth0 and Clerk.

## Improved Private Networking visibility

Users of [Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) can now view configured VPC endpoints on the project settings page in the Neon Console.

Private Networking is available on Neon's [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) and [Enterprise](/docs/introduction/plans#enterprise) plans. If you're on a different plan, you can request a trial from your project's settings page.
