## Backup and restore improvements

You can now schedule backups and restore from snapshots in Neon. Choose between:

- **One-step restore** — instantly restores a snapshot to the current branch
- **Multi-step restore** — restores to a new branch so you can verify the data before finalizing

Both restore options are supported via the Neon API, enabling use cases such as AI agent checkpoints.

## Improved Private Networking visibility

You can now view your private networking configuration directly in the Neon Console.

## Better project management with new project page features

If you manage many Neon projects, the project page now supports pagination, sorting, and filtering to help you stay organized.

## Laravel support added to app.build

Neon's full-stack app generator, `app.build`, now supports creating Laravel apps out of the box.

## Branch expiration for automatic cleanup

You can now set an expiration timestamp on branches to automatically delete them after a defined time. This helps keep environments clean and reduce storage usage for short-lived branches.

**How it works**  
Set an expiration timestamp (`expires_at`) when creating or updating a branch via the API, CLI, or Neon Console. Once the expiration time is reached, the branch and any associated compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**
- CI/CD pipelines that generate ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demo or AI environments

**Restrictions**
- You can't expire default, protected, or parent branches.
- Expired branches are permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
