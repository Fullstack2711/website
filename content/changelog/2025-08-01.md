## app.build adds web UI and Laravel support

[app.build](https://app.build), Neon's full-stack app generator, now has a web-based interface in addition to the terminal CLIâ€”making it easier to create full-stack apps directly from your browser. Learn more in the blog post: [Launching a Web UI for app.build](https://neon.com/blog/launching-a-web-ui-for-app-build).

**app.build** also now supports building and deploying **Laravel apps**. Check out the blog post: [Generate Laravel Apps from a Prompt](https://neon.com/blog/generate-laravel-apps-from-a-prompt).

## Improved Private Networking visibility

Users of [Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) can now view configured VPC endpoints on the project settings page in the Neon Console.

Private Networking is available on Neon's [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) and [Enterprise](/docs/introduction/plans#enterprise) plans. If you're on a different plan, you can request a trial from your project's settings page.
