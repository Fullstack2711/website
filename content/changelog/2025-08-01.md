## Backup and restore improvements

You can now schedule backups and restore from snapshots in Neon. Choose between:

- **One-step restore** — instantly restores a snapshot to the current branch
- **Multi-step restore** — restores to a new branch so you can verify the data before finalizing

Both restore options are supported via the Neon API, enabling use cases such as AI agent checkpoints.

## Improved Private Networking visibility

You can now view your private networking configuration directly in the Neon Console.

## Better project management with new project page features

If you manage many Neon projects, the project page now supports pagination, sorting, and filtering to help you stay organized.

## Laravel support added to app.build

Neon's full-stack app generator, `app.build`, now supports creating Laravel apps out of the box.
