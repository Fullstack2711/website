## app.build gets a web UI

[app.build](https://app.build), Neon's full-stack app generator, now features a web-based interface in addition to the existing terminal CLI. Previously available only as a command-line tool, you can now generate complete applications directly from your browser. Read the blog post to learn more: [Launching a Web UI for app.build
