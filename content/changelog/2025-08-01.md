## Backup and restore improvements

You can now schedule backups and restore from snapshots in Neon. Choose between:

- **One-step restore** — instantly restores a snapshot to the current branch
- **Multi-step restore** — restores to a new branch so you can verify the data before finalizing

Both restore options are supported via the Neon API, enabling use cases such as AI agent checkpoints.

## Improved Private Networking visibility

You can now view your private networking configuration directly in the Neon Console.

## Better project management with new project page features

If you manage many Neon projects, the project page now supports pagination, sorting, and filtering to help you stay organized.

## Laravel support added to app.build

Neon's full-stack app generator, `app.build`, now supports creating Laravel apps out of the box.

## app.build now available with web UI

`app.build`, Neon's full-stack app generator, now features a web-based interface in addition to the existing terminal CLI. Previously available only as a command-line tool, you can now generate complete applications directly from your browser.

**What's new**
- Web-based interface for creating full-stack applications
- Same powerful app generation capabilities as the CLI
- Support for all existing frameworks: Next.js, Laravel, Python data apps, and more
- Seamless integration with Neon databases

**Getting started**
Visit [app.build](https://app.build) to start generating applications with the new web interface, or continue using the CLI via terminal or Homebrew installation.

## Branch expiration for automatic cleanup

You can now set an expiration timestamp on branches to automatically delete them after a defined time. This helps keep environments clean and reduce storage usage for short-lived branches.

**How it works**  
Set an expiration timestamp (`expires_at`) when creating or updating a branch via the API, CLI, or Neon Console. Once the expiration time is reached, the branch and any associated compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**

- CI/CD pipelines that generate ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demo or AI environments

**Restrictions**

- You can't expire default, protected, or parent branches.
- Expired branches are permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
