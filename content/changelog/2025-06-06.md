## app.build

We're very happy to join the codegen community with [app.build](https://www.app.build/), our open-source reference implementation for AI-powered application generation. By default, app.build creates complete, production-ready applications using the Neon platform, including Neon Postgres, Neon Auth, and other Neon features (though you can also bring your own templates).

![sample app.build in action](/docs/relnotes/app_build.png)

While LLMs handle isolated coding problems well, app.build uses agent architecture to turn prompts into production-ready applications. It's fully open source, local-first, and built for developers looking to create their own codegen products on top of Neon.

### Why we built this:

- **Beyond code snippets** - Transforms prompts into complete, deployed applications with frontend, backend, and database
- **Community-driven development** - Open source for developers to bring their own models and run locally
- **True agent architecture** - Iterates on code, runs tests, and responds to feedback until everything works
- **Instant deployment** - Ships working apps with real infrastructure

### Getting started:

```bash
npx @app.build/cli
```

This single command creates and deploys a complete application with its own GitHub repository.

### How it works:

The agent decomposes app creation into validated tasks, running checks at each step to ensure everything works. This divide-and-conquer approach enables reliable generation of complex applications beyond simple code snippets.

## Netlify DB: One-click Postgres powered by Neon

We're excited to announce that Neon is now powering [Netlify DB](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-db-database-for-ai-native-development/), a new service that lets you provision production-ready Postgres databases directly from your Netlify project. With just one click in the Netlify Dashboard or a single CLI command (`netlify init db`), you can spin up a fully configured Neon database that's ready to use.

Netlify DB is designed to be the perfect database for AI-native development, offering:

- Instant provisioning with no external signup required
- Automatic environment variable configuration
- Zero-config setup with your deployed functions
- The ability to claim your database and link it to your Neon account when you're ready

This integration is part of Netlify's Agent Week initiative, making it easier for both developers and AI agents to build applications with a production-ready database. Learn more in the [Netlify DB documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/storage/netlify-db/).

## Neon Launchpad

Introducing **Neon Launchpad** at [neon.new](https://neon.new), which enables instant Postgres database provisioning without any configuration or account creation. This feature allows you to get a fully functional database in seconds and demonstrates Neon's [claimable database capabilities](https://neon.com/docs/workflows/claimable-database-integration) in action. You can build similar experiences to Neon Launchpad in your own application using the APIs documented in the integration guide.

### Key features include:

- **Zero-configuration setup** - No account required to get started
- **Multiple access methods** - Browser interface, CLI tools, and development integrations
- **Claimable databases** - Keep your database by claiming it with a Neon account within 72 hours

### Getting started

Get started immediately by visiting [neon.new](https://neon.new) in your browser, running `npx neondb` from the command line, or integrating automatic database provisioning into Vite projects with `@neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres`.

## Every new user gets an org

We've worked hard to make this major refactoring seamless, effortless, light as a feather when it comes to onboarding. You'll hardly notice a thing, but trust us, it was a lift. We are very satisfied to say that now **every new user starts with their own free org.** This simplifies our [object hierarchy](https://neon.com/docs/manage/overview) and helps improve our development velocity. It makes us happy. [Read more about organizations](/docs/manage/organizations).

## Add domains to Neon Auth

You can now whitelist redirect URIs for your deployed app directly in Neon Auth, without needing to create a Stack Auth account or transfer your project. This makes it easier to manage your app's authentication settings and simplifies your workflow.

For details on the new API endpoints, see the [Neon API updates](#neon-api-updates) section below.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
  - We updated the warning message to clarify that changing compute size settings will definitely interrupt database connections, rather than just possibly doing so. We want to make that clear so you know exactly what to expect.

- **Neon API**

  - We've added new API endpoints to help you manage your Neon Auth domains: [list domains](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listdomains), [add a domain](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/adddomain), and [delete a domain](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deletedomain). These endpoints make it easy to manage your redirect URIs programmatically.

- **Neon CLI**

  [CLI improvements]

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  For details about the latest Drizzle Studio updates, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Fixes**

  - Fixed an issue with IPv6 validation, ensuring that compressed IPv6 formats are properly validated. This improves stability and correctness for users relying on IPv6 functionality.
