## app.build

We're excited to launch app.build, an open-source agent that converts AI-generated code snippets into complete, deployed applications. While LLMs handle isolated coding problems well, app.build uses agent architecture to create production-ready apps.

### Why we built this:

- **Beyond code snippets** - Transforms prompts into complete, deployed applications with frontend, backend, and database
- **Community-driven development** - Open source for developers to bring their own models and run locally
- **True agent architecture** - Iterates on code, runs tests, and responds to feedback until everything works
- **Instant deployment** - Ships working apps with real infrastructure

### Getting started:

```bash
npx @app.build/cli
```

This single command creates and deploys a complete application with its own GitHub repository.

### How it works:

The agent decomposes app creation into validated tasks, running checks at each step to ensure everything works. This divide-and-conquer approach enables reliable generation of complex applications beyond simple code snippets.

## Neon Launchpad

Introducing **Neon Launchpad** at [neon.new](https://neon.new), which enables instant Postgres database provisioning without any configuration or account creation. This feature allows you to get a fully functional database in seconds and demonstrates Neon's [claimable database capabilities](https://neon.com/docs/workflows/claimable-database-integration) in action. You can build similar experiences to Neon Launchpad in your own application using the APIs documented in the integration guide.

### Key features include:

- **Zero-configuration setup** - No account required to get started
- **Multiple access methods** - Browser interface, CLI tools, and development integrations
- **Claimable databases** - Keep your database by claiming it with a Neon account within 72 hours

### Getting started

Get started immediately by visiting [neon.new](https://neon.new) in your browser, running `npx neondb` from the command line, or integrating automatic database provisioning into Vite projects with `@neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres`.
