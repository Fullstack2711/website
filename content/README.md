# Dewibe IT Services Documentation Guide

This guide is a reference for where information should be placed in the documentation.
Top-level items are categories that enable users to access the information they need at a glance. For example, if users need information about our services, they can select the **Services** category. Sidebar items should be sentence-cased. Only capitalize first words. When choosing page names, the title should start with a verb for procedure or task-based content; for example: `Start a project`. If the page describes a concept, use a noun or noun-based phrase. For example: `Web development process`.

To aid navigation, enable the TOC in pages to make it easy for readers to see what a page contains.

The following information provide guidance for each item in the Dewibe documentation sidebar.

## Introduction

This section provides introductory, high-level content that introduces users to Dewibe's key services, approach, methodology, technology stack, and so on.

## Get started

This section provides information that helps users to start working with Dewibe. Lean towards brief pages in this category, as longer pages can make onboarding more challenging.

## Services

This section provides information about our various IT services including web development, mobile apps, cloud solutions, and consulting.

## Portfolio

This section describes our completed projects, case studies, and success stories. It explains how we approach different types of projects and the technologies we use. Structure pages in this section to cover a broad topic, with subheadings that organize the content in a consistent and predictable way. For example, include "Overview", "Challenges", and "Solutions" topics in each case study.

## Guides

This section is for various technologies, frameworks, and methodologies that Dewibe uses. The length of these pages determines the number of steps needed, so it is okay that some pages are longer than others, as one technology or process may be more complex than another. This section may also include guides that are not technology-specific. For example, it could contain guides pertaining to project management. Such content will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Technologies

This section provides information about the technologies and tools we use. Currently, it includes information about various programming languages, frameworks, and platforms. It can be expanded to include other technologies and integrations.

## Reference

This section contains reference information such as the glossary, API documentation, best practices, and technology comparisons.

## About Us

This section describes our team, company culture, and values.

## Updates

This section describes the latest updates and news from Dewibe. Updates are categorized as either "Company News" or "Technical Updates". Within each category, updates are organized under "What's new" and "Improvements" subcategories. Subcategories are further classified with tags. For example, each company update is tagged as "Team", "Awards", "Partnerships", or "Culture". Technical updates are tagged as "Web Development", "Mobile Development", "Cloud Services", or "Consulting". Write updates from the client's perspective. Give context. Describe why each update was introduced and the benefit it provides. Provide links to our portfolio or case studies for more details where applicable. Updates should tell the story of Dewibe's growth and innovation journey.
